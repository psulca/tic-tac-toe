# Tic Tac Toe 

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game built using Vite, React, and Typescript. It also incorporates vivus for draw animations.

## How To Play

- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- Two players take turns to place their mark (either "X" or "O") on an empty cell.
- The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
- If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game is a draw.
